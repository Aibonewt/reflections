When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    In case you were away from your personal computer, or you were collaborating with other contributors.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because otherwise it would probably overwrite something you were working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    I would use fork to elaborate or modify someone else's work without altering their copy.
    Clone is used to copy a complete repo from GitHub to work on locally.
    Branch is used to elaborate or modify your own work without affecting your master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It allows you to perform compare commits offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Don't know. It would be easier to not collaborate at all, and much harder if using a shared network drive.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
